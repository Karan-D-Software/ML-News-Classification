## üëãüèΩ Introduction 
In the information age, effectively categorizing news articles is essential for managing the vast amounts of daily content. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify news articles into predefined categories. We aim to develop a robust classification system using the BBC news dataset, which includes articles spanning business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology. This endeavour will enhance our understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and improve our ability to manage and interpret large text corpora efficiently.

## üéØ Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model capable of accurately classifying BBC news articles into one of five categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. To achieve this goal, we will utilize matrix factorization techniques, specifically non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Additionally, we will compare the performance of this method against traditional supervised learning approaches. In a complementary analysis, we will evaluate the limitations of sklearn‚Äôs NMF library by applying it to a movie ratings dataset, comparing its efficacy against more straightforward baseline methods, and proposing potential improvements.
